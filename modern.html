      <p>
        Modern web servers are powerful, efficient, and essential to the global internet ecosystem. Apache, one of the oldest yet still relevant servers, continues to serve millions of sites with flexibility and stability. NGINX has emerged as a high-performance alternative known for its ability to handle massive concurrent connections efficiently. Microsoft’s IIS continues to thrive in enterprise Windows environments, while LiteSpeed offers lightning-fast performance for content-heavy websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today’s web servers support not only static HTML files but also dynamic content, databases, APIs, and frameworks like Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails. They work seamlessly with modern technologies including containers (e.g., Docker), CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native services. All of this enables developers to scale websites and applications quickly and securely across global audiences.

      <!-- the List for the modern web trends -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud and Serverless Computing</strong> – 
          Platforms like <em>AWS Lambda</em>, <em>Azure Functions</em>, and <em>Google Cloud Functions</em> handle scaling and uptime automatically, enabling developers to focus on code without managing infrastructure.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>HTTPS Everywhere</strong> – 
          HTTPS is now the standard for secure web communication. With free SSL from providers like <em>Let’s Encrypt</em>, secure delivery is accessible to all developers.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Edge Computing and AI Integration</strong> – 
          Platforms like <em>Cloudflare Workers</em> and <em>Fastly Compute@Edge</em> bring code execution closer to users, reducing latency and enabling smart, fast, location-aware apps.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</strong> – 
          PWAs offer app-like experiences with offline support, push notifications, and installability on desktop or mobile—all via web technologies.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>WebAssembly (WASM)</strong> – 
          WASM allows languages like <em>C</em>, <em>Rust</em>, and <em>Go</em> to run in the browser at near-native speeds, unlocking powerful applications like games, video editors, and scientific simulations.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>API-First Architecture</strong> – 
          REST and GraphQL APIs drive modern applications, allowing frontends to pull dynamic data from modular services across devices.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Containerization and Microservices</strong> – 
          Technologies like <em>Docker</em> and <em>Kubernetes</em> enable modular, scalable app architecture. These support CI/CD for fast deployment and updates.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Static Site Generators & JAMstack</strong> – 
          Tools like <em>Next.js</em>, <em>Hugo</em>, and <em>Eleventy</em> generate fast, secure sites. JAMstack decouples the frontend and backend, improving performance and deployment via CDNs.
